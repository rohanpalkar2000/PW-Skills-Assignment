    "Class − \n",

    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects (an instance of the class). It defines a set of attributes and behaviors that an object of that class will have. A class can be considered as a blueprint for the object or objects that can be created using it.\n",

    "    Abstraction refers to the practice of exposing only the relevant information and hiding the complexity of the implementation. \n",

    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "    Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This is achieved in OOP by defining methods with the same name in different classes that are related by inheritance. \n",
    "    When a method is called on an object, the correct implementation of that method is executed based on the object's actual class."
