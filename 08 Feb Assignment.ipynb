    "Abstraction and Encapsulation are related concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they are different in their nature and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is an OOP concept that focuses only on relevant data of an object. It hides the background details and emphasizes the essential data points for reducing the complexity and increase efficiency. \n",
    "It generally retains only information which is most relevant for that specific process. Abstraction method mainly focusses on the idea instead of actual functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a method of making a complex system easier to handle for end users. The user need not worry about internal details and complexities of the system. Encapsulation is a process of wrapping the data and the code, that operate on the data into a single entity. \n",
    "You can assume it as a protective wrapper that stops random access of code defined outside that wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a bank account object in OOP. The abstraction of the bank account object could be represented by its properties such as account number and balance, and methods such as deposit and withdraw. The user of this bank account object does not need to know the internal workings of how the bank manages the account, such as how the deposit or withdraw methods update the balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encapsulation of the bank account object could be achieved by declaring the properties such as account number and balance as private, and providing the methods such as deposit and withdraw as public. This encapsulation ensures that the user can only access the account information through the provided methods and cannot directly access or modify the account number or balance properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Abstraction focuses on hiding the implementation details, while Encapsulation focuses on binding the data and methods within a single unit and restricting the direct access to the data."

    "Abstract base classes provide a way to define interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that donâ€™t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() functions. There are many built-in ABCs in Python. ABCs for Data structures like Iterator, Generator, Set, mapping etc. are defined in collections.abc module. The numbers module defines numeric tower which is a collection of base classes for numeric data types. The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.\n",

    "Encapsulation: This is the process of binding data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object. By encapsulating data within an object, you can restrict direct access to the data from outside the object and ensure data integrity and security.\n",

By declaring data members as private, you can restrict direct access to the data from outside the object, thereby implementing data abstraction.\n",

    "Abstract Classes: Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are meant to be subclassed. They provide a way to define an interface that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses. By defining abstract classes and methods, you can enforce a certain interface on the concrete implementations, thereby achieving data abstraction.\n",
