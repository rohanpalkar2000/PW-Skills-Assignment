    "### Primary key:\n",
    "The primary key is a unique or non-null key that uniquely identifies every record in a table or relation. Each database needs a unique identifier for every row of a table, and the primary key plays a vital role in identifying rows in the table uniquely. The primary key column can't store duplicate values. It is also called a minimal super key; therefore, we cannot specify more than one primary key in any relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have a table named customer with attributes such as ID, Name, and City. Only the ID column can never contain duplicate and NULL values because each customer has a unique identification number. This feature helps to identify each record in the database uniquely. Hence, we can make the ID attribute a primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign key:\n",
    "The foreign key is a group of one or more columns in a database to uniquely identify another database record in some other table to maintain the referential integrity. It is also known as the referencing key that establishes a relationship between two different tables in a database. A foreign key always matches the primary key column in another table. It means a foreign key column in one table refers to the primary key column of another table. A foreign key is beneficial in relational database normalization, especially when we need to access records from other tables.\n",
    "A foreign key creates a parent-child relationship with the tables where the parent table holds the initial column values, and the child table references the parent column values. We can achieve this relationship only when the foreign key constraint is found on the child table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have a table named contact with attributes such as ID, Customer_Id, Customer_Info, and Type. Here we can make the Customer_Id column a foreign key.\n",

    "#### If we want to delete the referential data that removes records from both tables, we can define the foreign key in the contact table as below:\n",
